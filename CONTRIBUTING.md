# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution! Simplicity is a core feature of this extension, so please keep that in mind when proposing changes.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run build       # production build
npm run watch       # rebuild on changes
npm run typecheck   # type-check without emitting
npm test            # run unit tests
```

Load the `dist/` directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome (or any Chromium browser) to test locally.

2. Make your changes. Add or update tests if relevant.
3. Run `npm run typecheck && npm test` and make sure everything passes.
